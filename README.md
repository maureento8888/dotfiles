# Bash Customizations

My personal customizations for my bash prompt.

## Installation
These are my personalized dotfiles so do download and use at your own risk! Feel free to `git clone <repo url>` the files to make your own customizations and take out what's not needed. Be sure to move or clone into a new or separate directory so you can access later if you want to revert changes.

### Note
- Some argue to not fork
